            <p>No one said this would be easy.  Running a cafe is hard enough, but now you've also got bills, inventory, and repairs to keep up with!</p>

                <h3>Utilities</h3>
                <p>At the end of every week, there is a chance one of your utilities (gas, electricity, plumbing) shuts off, and it's your job to turn it back on by paying the bill.</p>
                <p>If you ever finish a full week with no utilities active, your cafe is closed for repair, and you lose the game.</p>
                <p>To turn a utility back on, just click on the faded icon.  If you have enough money to pay for it, it will turn back on and your cafe will stay in business!</p>

                <p>Having just opened, your cafe could still use some work.  The two upgrade options found in the bottom right corner can be purchased at any point.</p>
                <p>These upgrades provide you with a little context about what part of your cafe they'll improve, but they also come with drawbacks!</p>
                <p>Whenever you purchase an upgrade, it will be swapped out with a new one for you to consider.</p>

                <p>At any point, you can click the "Buy" button beneath an ingredient to fully restock it to its maximum capacity.</p>

            <p>Throughout your game, there is a chance that a witch enters your shop and offers you a deal.</p>
            <p>She will explain the possible consequences of her spells, but it's up to you to decide if you can take the risk.</p>
            <p>You can refuse her offers with no consequences.  If you accept, she will tell you the effects of her spell.  The witch will not offer you another spell until you either accept or refuse her current offer.</p>

            <h3>Stats</h3>
            <p>This game handles lots of variables, so it's best if you understand what each of them means.</p>
            <p>Score: This is what you look at between playthroughs of this game to see how you did.  Buying upgrades and serving customers increases it.</p>
            <p>Prestige: Keep this value as high as you can.  Serving customers increases it, but failing to serve a customer lowers your prestige.  If prestige hits 0, your cafe closes!</p>
            <p>Coins: This is how you pay for upgrades, utilities, and restocking ingredients.  Serving customers gains you coins.</p>
